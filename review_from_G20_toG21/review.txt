This is a review for Group 21 from Group 20 
1.What you think they did well (and why)
They've tried many ways to improve the performance. In the report, they give a detailed discussion about what they tried and what the result looks like. 
They have a good plan for future optimizations.

2.What you think they could improve on (and why)
They could try different combinations. For example, they could try to change block size or compiling flags after adding the restrict key word. These things may have interaction effect.
They can give more details on why certain optimizations were successful.
They can make comparisons to the reference implementations.

3.Anything else you would like to add
I think this group did things similar to us. So it's useful for us to see what they've tried.
Figure 1 is hard to read because the mkl implementation is much higher than the others.
